      <div class="intro">The 3rd Edition of TEDxIIT Patna, Roar- The Acoustic of Strength celebrated the spirit of
        resilience and inner strength. Nothing can silence the sound that roars from within - <span
          style="font-style: italic">the stronger one's will, the greater is their innate power</span>. The moment we
        rise above our fear of being judged and take control of our thoughts, we become capable of summoning the
        strength needed to face the most significant adversities. Unleash the roar of freedom, call upon spiritual power
        and join us on the path towards a better, stronger mindset.
