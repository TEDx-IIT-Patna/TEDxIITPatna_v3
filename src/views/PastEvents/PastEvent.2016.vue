        TEDxIITPatna believes that building anything new is possible when we let go of the old. Just as birds shed their
        feathers, allowing the new ones to embrace, taking them afresh to infinite skies, bringing out change is an
        inevitable part of one's life to keep walking the course of life.<br><br>
        <span>A change within us to become better.</span><br>
        <span>A change within the society to make this a better place to live in.</span>
