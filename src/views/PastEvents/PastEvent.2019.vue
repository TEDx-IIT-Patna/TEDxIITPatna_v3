      <div class="intro">
        The 2nd Edition of TEDxIITPatna, Metamorphosis, put forth the ideology
        that permanence is an illusion, and everything in this universe is
        susceptible to change. Change is not always bad- it often brings
        opportunities to transform into something better. While change is
        inevitable, it is upon us to grow and adapt to the evolution of our
        surroundings. We had experts discuss the effects of rapid and drastic
        changes on technology, entertainment, but most importantly, on people
        and societal values.
